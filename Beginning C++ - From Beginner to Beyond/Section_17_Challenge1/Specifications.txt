Section 17 Challenge 1

Create a program that has the following:

1. A function named 'make' that creates and returns a unique_ptr to a vector of shared_ptrs to Test Objects.

2. A function named 'fill' that expects a vector of shared pointers to Test Objects and an int representing the
   number of Test objects to create dynamically and add to the vector.

   This function will prompt the user to enter an integer, create a shared_ptr to a Test object initialized to
   the entered integer and add that shared pointer to the vector.

3. A function named 'display' that expects a vector of shared_ptrs to Test objects and displays the data in each 
   Test object.

4. The main driver should look like the following:

    int main(){

        std::unique_ptr<std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Test>>> vec_ptr;
        vec_ptr = make();

        std::cout << "How many data points do you want to enter: " << std::endl;
        int num;
        std::cin >> num;
        fill(*vec_ptr, num);
        display(*vec_ptr);

        return 0;

    }

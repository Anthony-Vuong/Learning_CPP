Section 18 Challenge 

For this challenge we want to integrate our own user defined exception classes into the Account class hierarchy.

The account classes are provided for you. Also the IllegalBalanceException.h file contains the declaration for
the IllegalBalanceException class.

What to do:
1. Derive IllegalBalanceException from std::exception and implement the what() method to proivde an exception
   message. This exception object should be thrown from the Account class constructor is an account object is
   created with a negative balance.

2. Derive InsufficientFundsException from std::exception and implement the what() method to provide an exception 
   message. This exception should be thrown if a withdraw results in a negative balance. You should throw this 
   exception object from the Account withdraw method.

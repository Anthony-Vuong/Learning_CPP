*Note: An issue occurred where compiling test resulted in MakeErrors when finding Thread Library.
Please see the following post on how to fix it:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5395309/how-do-i-force-cmake-to-include-pthread-option-during-compilation

Follow the first tutorial to install and the second to fix the Thread Library Issue. In addition, you need
to include your source/header files you want to test in the file that includes your text fixture and test 
main() method.

For a tutorial on how to setup GTestFixtures follow this tutorial:
http://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html


Once TestFixture is setup, TestCases can be setup, ensure you name each test something descriptive.

On the command line, to build with cmake do the following:

cmake CMakeList.txt
make
./name_of_executable

The above assumes you have followed the first tutorial.
